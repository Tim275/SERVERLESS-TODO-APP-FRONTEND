### Servier-Side-Feautures:

1. **AWS Lambda Functions**: Six AWS Lambda functions are used to handle all the server-side operations. These operations include Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations, and two additional operations for specific tasks.
2. **API Gateway**: AWS API Gateway is used as the entry point for the client-side requests. It routes the incoming requests to the appropriate Lambda functions.
3. **DynamoDB**: AWS DynamoDB is used as the database for storing all the todo items. It provides fast and flexible non-relational database service for any scale.
4. **Scalability**: The serverless architecture allows the application to automatically scale up and down based on the demand. This means the application can handle any number of users.
